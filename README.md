# Renty

This is a work example I prepared for Rentable on Oct. 12th, 2024. It's a Rails app which allows 
users to upload properties (address/city/state), add units to those properties (showing 
their number of beds and baths, square footage, and monthly rent), and search for 
uploaded properties by city.

Important things to ensure you have installed:
* Ruby version: **3.2.2**
* Rails version: **7.1.4**
* Database: **Postgres**

To set up your enviornment, you'll need to install all dependencies. Run:

1. `bundle install`
2. `bin/importmap pin @stimulus-components/rails-nested-form`

Then initialize and seed the database:

1. `rails db:create`
2. `rails db:migrate`
3. `rails db:seed`

200 properties with a varying number of units (probably somewhere around 900) will be 
generated by Faker.

Finally, run the app as usual with `rails s`.

Once the app is running, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000 and click around! Search for 
a city, add a new property, or edit some existing ones to your heart's content.

NOTE: I didn't define any tests for this app, nor did I configure the existing ones. I 
can't vouch for the performance or accuracy of any generated tests.
